# Patterns to ignore when packaging Helm charts.
# This supports shell glob matching, relative path matching, and regex matching.
# Glob examples:
#   - '*.txt' matches all .txt files.
#   - '*/temp*' matches all files in a directory named `temp` (or containing `temp` in their names).
#   - 'foo/bar' matches a file or directory named `bar` in the `foo` directory.
# Regex examples:
#   - '\.git' matches a literal `.git` directory (not a file extension).
#   - '\.png$' matches all .png files.
# Relative path examples:
#   - 'foo' matches a file or directory named `foo` in the current directory.
#   - 'foo/*' matches all files or directories within `foo`.
